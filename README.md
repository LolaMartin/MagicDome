# MagicDome
Proyect from Creative Electronic, subject of Sistemas Electrónicos of Universidad de Málaga

Made with 2 class, one libary for the colors, once .ino and one main how example.
With the 2 class, leds, and sensors, we can control all ilumination of dome, and with sensor class, we can
use differents functions with differentes parameters and utilitys to controle the 40 sensors of dome.

Library colors is codified and decodified by a function from leds class, to manage all colors you can in it.

In sensor, we have 3 class, sensor, simon and piano, who they work separated to manage sensors and do separate
things having more or less the same structure, but with little changes to shape is own functions.

With the opening.ino we could add a melody in the turn on of dome, it can be changed easily adding new frecuencies
and durations from the new melody.
